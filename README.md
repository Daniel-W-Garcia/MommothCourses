# Mamoth Club Courses Repository

This repository contains my coding exercises, notes, and projects from various courses I'm taking on Mamoth Club.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to organize and document my learning journey from multiple Mamoth Club courses focused on programming, data science, machine learning, and related topics.

Each subfolder or section corresponds to a different course with its own specific content including exercises, projects, and notes.

## Current Courses Included

- Introduction to Machine Learning and Python Data Science

More courses will be added here as I progress through other Mamoth Club offerings.

## How to Use This Repository
