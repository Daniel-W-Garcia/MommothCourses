# What is pandas?
# ----------------
# Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis
# and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. The name
# "pandas" is derived from "panel data," an econometrics term for multidimensional
# structured data sets. Its two primary data structures are `Series` (1-dimensional)
# and `DataFrame` (2-dimensional), which are the workhorses for most data tasks.

# When is pandas used?
# -------------------
# Pandas is a cornerstone of the Python data science ecosystem and is used for a
# wide range of tasks across the entire data analysis pipeline:
# - Data Cleaning and Wrangling: Handling missing data (NaNs), filtering rows
#   and columns based on conditions, transforming data types, and reshaping data.
# - Data Exploration and Analysis: Calculating summary statistics (mean, median,
#   standard deviation), grouping data for aggregate calculations (e.g., sum,
#   mean, count by category), and performing complex queries.
# - Data I/O: It's the go-to library for reading and writing data from/to various
#   formats like CSV, Excel spreadsheets, SQL databases, JSON, Parquet, and more.
# - Time Series Analysis: It has robust, built-in tools for working with
#   time-stamped data, which is crucial in fields like finance and IoT.

# Why is pandas so good?
# ----------------------
# Pandas is incredibly popular for several key reasons:
# 1.  **Intuitive Data Structures:** The `DataFrame` object is like a super-powered
#     spreadsheet or SQL table directly in your code. It's easy to understand and
#     manipulate, with labeled rows (index) and columns, making your code more
#     readable and maintainable.
# 2.  **Rich and Powerful API:** It offers a vast collection of functions that allow
#     you to join, merge, reshape, pivot, and slice datasets with just a few lines
#     of code, saving you from writing complex loops.
# 3.  **Performance:** While Python can be slow for loops, pandas leverages NumPy
#     and C/Cython in the background for many of its operations. This makes
#     data processing incredibly fast and memory-efficient.
# 4.  **Excellent Integration:** It works seamlessly with other major data science
#     libraries like NumPy (for numerical operations), Matplotlib/Seaborn (for
#     plotting), and Scikit-learn (for machine learning).
# 5.  **Handling of Missing Data:** It has first-class support for representing and
#     manipulating missing data, which is a common and critical problem in
#     real-world datasets.

import pandas as pd

# --- Example: A quick demonstration of pandas' power ---

# 1. Create a DataFrame from a dictionary
# This is a common way to create a small dataset for testing.
data = {
    'Product': ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Bananas', 'Apples', 'Oranges', 'Bananas'],
    'Salesperson': ['John', 'Anna', 'John', 'Mike', 'Anna', 'Mike'],
    'Quantity': [25, 30, 45, 15, 50, 60],
    'Price': [1.2, 1.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, 0.8]
}
sales_df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("Original Sales DataFrame:")
print(sales_df)
print("\n" + "=" * 40 + "\n")

# 2. Perform some quick analysis and manipulation
# Calculate a new column 'Revenue' by multiplying 'Quantity' and 'Price'.
# This is an example of fast, "vectorized" operations.
sales_df['Revenue'] = sales_df['Quantity'] * sales_df['Price']

print("DataFrame with calculated 'Revenue' column:")
print(sales_df)
print("\n" + "=" * 40 + "\n")

# 3. Use groupby() to aggregate data
# This is one of the most powerful features of pandas. Here, we calculate
# the total revenue generated by each salesperson.
revenue_by_salesperson = sales_df.groupby('Salesperson')['Revenue'].sum()

print("Total Revenue by Salesperson:")
print(revenue_by_salesperson)
